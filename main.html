	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity describes how efficiently an algorithm runs as the size of the input increases, and an efficient algorithm minimizes the time required to produce the result.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> explains the amount of memory an algorithm needs during execution, and it is commonly represented using notations such as O(n) to indicate linear space usage.</p>
